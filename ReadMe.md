# BetterLinks

BetterLinks adds support for the new server links feature in 1.21+. This adds a new button to the game menu, which when
pressed will bring you to a new menu with buttons showing customizable text heading to customizable URLs.

This project and its collaborators use the following regularly and are thankful for their maintenance:
- [PacketEvents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents)
- [sharkbyte-configuration](https://github.com/amnoah/sharkbyte-configuration)

## Requirements

This plugin only supports 1.21+ on platforms with an existing BetterLinks implementation. This includes Spigot,
Paper (and its forks), Folia, Sponge, and (soon) Fabric.

## Quick Feature Breakdown
- Platform independent design.
- Fully packet-based.
- Color code support.
- Weight-based, allowing for sorting.

For individual platform features, please check each module.
